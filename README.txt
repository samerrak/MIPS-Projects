<---COMP303 Projects--->

1. To say this course is hard would be understatement, but the amount of stuff that you will learn on assignments definitely makes it worth it. 

2. The first and second assignment were simple enough, just building registers, flip-flops and circuits using Logisim, and some basic MIPS programs

3. Assembly language is really important to learn, esp if you're interested in comp sci topics, therefore take the time to really understand the material

4. A3 introduced image processing, it definitely was the hardest thing that I have done at McGill, A4 was a bit easier and more fun working on creating a working Snake program is actually very interesting but also just working on the tower of Hanoi and life is cool.
